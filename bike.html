  <p class = indent> Ever since shelter in place began, I found myself biking a lot more. With all this extra free time, I figured might as well explore the Bay Area while getting some fitness out of it. After finding a free
  bike frame by the garbage, I began fixing it up with used parts from Craigslist. This led to a new obsession, and I found myself looking for bikes to ride and to fix. I began mountain biking, dirt jumping, tandem biking
with my mother. Looking for someone to hit up dirt jumps and soquel demo forest with. :)</p>
