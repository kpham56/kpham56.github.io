  <p class = indent> Assembled a mechanical keyboard by hand. Opened 48 cherry MX clear switches, replaced with aftermarket springs
    to reduce acutation force, and lubricated all contact points to ensure quiet and consistent feedback. Solder switches
    to PCB, as well as an LED diode for each switch. Installed rubber O-rings on each keycap stem to silence chatter.
     Once assembled, the keyboard was programmed using QMK to change the keymaps.
    The Plank features multiple layers, an ultracompact size and an ergonomic ortholinear set up.</p>

    <p class = indent> Unfortunately, after a mistake involving liquids, the keyboard refused to communicate. The poor Plank was then
      dismantled, rinsed in deionized water and carefully airdried and swabbed with qtips. After it's intense open-heart
      surgery, the keyboard was reassembled, tested, and sold to a new loving owner. Have not had contact with him, but I like to believe
    that this keyboard is living a good life, loved and used daily, and kept away from dangerous liquids. Overall a fun, albiet expensive hobby.</p>
