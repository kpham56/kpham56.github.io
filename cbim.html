  <p class = indent> For my CMPE 126 Lab class, my final project was to create a program that would help people. For my proposal, I decided to make an inventory manager
    for online sales. As someone who has used paypal, ebay, cragislist and depop to sell things, it gets messy remembering. I built this console based app to help me
  manage items. This program feautres the ability to track quantity, titles, price, weight, and mark whether the product has been shipped or not. It keeps track of each
  item by using a data structure made by me. The most challenging part of the program was making the save and load function work properly. It required lots of text parsing
  and really showed me how to manage file inputs and output in C++. If I were to do it again, I would restructure the code to use a doubly linked list instead of a dynamic array.</p>
