<div class = tab id = content>
  <p class = indent> I've been interested in cars for a while, and the last couple of years I have been getting my hands dirty. I recently obtained my M1 license and
  began riding motorcycles as well. Currently drive a 2008 Subaru WRX Hatchback, and ride a 2005 Yamaha Vstar. My goal is to keep the WRX mainly stock until after college, and begin
  chasing power and handling once I have a big boy job. The Vstar is very sentimental, for it was given to me by a past friend's father. As much as I love it, I am currently looking for
something more sporty and modern, so if you know anyone selling a DRZ400sm, SV650, CBR600RR or FZ07 let me know.</p>
